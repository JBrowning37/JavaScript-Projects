# JavaScript-Projects

This showcases all of the projects I worked on while working on the JavaScript Course at The Tech Academy. Projects 1-10 were coding assignments to get comfortable with JavaScript. The three big projects were made by taking what I had learned in the coding assignments and applying them to the projects. 

# Pizza Project

This project is a menu for ordering pizza with different sizing and topping options. It takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

# TicTacToe Project

This is a simple tic tac toe game where you play against the computer. There are fun sound effects when things are place, or when you lose, tie, or win! It then resets automatically.

# Calculator Project:

A basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
