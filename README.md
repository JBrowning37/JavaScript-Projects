# JavaScript-Projects

This is for all of the projects that I will be working on during the JavaScript Course with The Tech Academy.

Some of the small projects include:

Pizza Project:

This project is a menu for ordering pizza with different sizing and topping options. It takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

TicTacToe Project:

This is a simple tic tac toe game where you play against the computer. There are fun sound effects when things are place, or when you lose, tie, or win! It then resets automatically.

Calculator Project:

A basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
